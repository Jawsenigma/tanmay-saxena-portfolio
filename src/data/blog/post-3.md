# 🎓 Education

Throughout my academic path, I've built a strong foundation in software engineering principles, system design, and hands-on development. Here's a look at where it all started and how it's going:

---

## 🐊 University of Florida  
**Master of Science in Computer Science**  
_Aug 2023 – May 2025 · Gainesville, FL_  
**GPA:** 3.89 / 4.00

- Focused on scalable systems, backend architecture, cloud-native applications, and AI integration.
- Active member of the ACM chapter, contributing to real-world projects and dashboard performance optimization.
- Completed courses on Advanced Data Structures, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, and Deep Learning.

## 🏫 SRM Institute of Science and Technology  
**B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering**  
_Jun 2016 – May 2020 · Chennai, India_  
**GPA:** 8.58 / 10.00

- Built a strong technical foundation across electronics, programming, and problem-solving.
- Participated in robotics and IoT hackathons; transitioned into full-stack development in the final year.
- Led academic projects blending hardware interfacing with software APIs.
