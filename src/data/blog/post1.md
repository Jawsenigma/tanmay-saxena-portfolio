# Welcome to my corner of the internet 👋

Over the last few years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on some pretty exciting full-stack projects across industries — from autonomous vehicles to AI-powered tools. Below are a few highlights from that journey.

## 🛍 UniBazaar – Real-Time Marketplace

**Tech:** Go, PostgreSQL, React, Tailwind CSS, AWS, Docker  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jawsenigma/UniBazaar) • 🌐 [Live Site](https://uni-bazaar.vercel.app/)

UniBazaar was built as a high-performance, scalable e-commerce platform. It supports real-time chat using WebSockets and achieves 99.9% uptime on AWS. I optimized REST APIs and WebSocket handling in Go, reducing API latency by 35%.

## 📝 Essay Evaluator – AI for Education

**Tech:** Python, Django, OpenAI API, PostgreSQL, React  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jawsenigma/Backend_Django_Essay_Evaluator)

This project leverages the power of OpenAI to grade essays automatically. I streamlined the onboarding flow using Google SSO and reduced manual grading efforts by 40%. It’s a smart blend of NLP and practical automation.

## 🔒 Text-Redactor – Privacy First

**Tech:** Python  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jawsenigma/Text-Redactor)

Developed a Python package to intelligently redact PII from large datasets. Regex-based optimization led to 60% faster text processing. Used extensively in document scrubbing workflows to boost data compliance.

## What’s Next?

As I wrap up my Master's at the University of Florida, I'm actively exploring opportunities where I can contribute to engineering teams solving large-scale, meaningful problems.

Thanks for reading! If any of these projects resonate with you, feel free to [reach out](mailto:tanmaysaxena@ufl.edu) or explore more on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Jawsenigma).
